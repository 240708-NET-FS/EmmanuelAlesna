- Idea: console app with investment portfolio tools
  - Start with displaying all options
    - Current stats, percentages of portfolio, totals
    - Rebalancing
    - Potentially projections
  - Validate entries (no negative numbers, nonzero, only numbers)
  - Have feature where portfolios can be saved into profiles that can also be loaded
    - Profiles should be accessed using usernames and passwords
  - Reach: visualize data using graphs
  --------------
  Database Stuff
  - Have tables for accounts, indexed by ID
  - Have password hashes stored separately, linked to account ID
  - Have password salts stored separately, linked to account ID

  Account Table (account information):
  - Account ID (auto generated)
  - Username
  Portfolio table (actual financial information): [now combined with account table]
  - Foreign key on account ID
  - All tickers as column, with holdings as values (should probably just have predefined columns)
    - Or have all tickers in single column which holds all tickers and their values
  Passwords table:
  - Foreign key on account ID
  - Password hash
  - Password salt
